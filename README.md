# Open Management Portal - Deployment

This repository both bootstraps and manages the deployment lifecycle of the Open Management Portal across multiple versions. It contains a manifest which controls the release version of all individual components of OMP. It is meant to be used with Argo CD.

## Bootstrapping

To create an instance of the Open Management Portal in a cluster, apply the `bootstrap` Helm chart using the following command:

```sh
helm dep up bootstrap
helm install open-management-portal bootstrap/ --set application.ref=<desired git ref>
```

If you would also like to deploy ArgoCD as part of your bootstrapping, apply the `bootstrap` Helm chart using the following command:

```sh
helm dep up bootstrap
helm install open-management-portal bootstrap/ -f <values-file-containing-secrets-data> --set application.ref=<desired git ref>
```

**Note:** For obvious reasons, you likely want to store your values file containing your secrets in a seperate, secure repository.

An example of a values file that contains the appropriate ArgoCD secrets data can be found [here](bootstrap/values-secrets-example.yaml). 

Make sure to replace `<desired-git-ref>` with the tag that you want to deploy to this cluster. If this is a staging cluster, you might have a Git tag such as `deploy-staging`; and if this is a production cluster, maybe `deploy-production`.

## Lifecycle Management

The Open Management Portal is not a single application, but a collection of components (or services) that all add up to a working system. Those services might be versioned separately from one another. Therefore, a "deployment of OMP" is really a manifest of the versions of its constituent components that are known to work well with each other.

This manifest lives in `applications/values.yaml`:

```yaml
applicationVersions:
  frontend: &frontendVersion 4edb30
  backend: &backendVersion 3a03d2
  git-api: &gitApiVersion 8cb605
  launcher: &launcherVersion 8bca47
  ...
  appName: &yamlAnchorName <ref-to-deploy>
```

NOTE: Because Helm does not support templating inside of the `values.yaml` file, we need to use [YAML anchors](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/yaml-anchors-960154027.html) if we want to prevent duplicate definitions of data.

Automatic syncing, pruning, and self healing is enabled for this project - so committing a change to the above manifest and tagging it appropriately as `deploy-staging` or `deploy-production` will cause an Argo CD instance bootstrapped with that tag to deploy those versions of the applications.
